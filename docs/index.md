Hello! We're looking for two roles at <https://www.mentimeter.com/|Mentimeter >that are both very close to my heart Data :heart: Product

The first is a Lead Data Scientist in the Product team -- if you are all about fostering data-driven decision making across the organisation, from A/B testing guidelines to leading embedded Product Data Scientists to help optimise good data practices within their teams -- this may well be the role for you :slightly_smiling_face:

The other is a Product Insights Director, who will be leading the data-driven efforts within the Product team, working closely with our VP of Product. In other words, to be the champion for data-driven ways of working, including proactive analyses, A/B testing best practices, continuous actionable insights and empowering dashboards within Product.

We are a product-first, profitable company where our goal is to make it easy to listen and to be heard. Our working culture is very important to us and while we are currently remote-first, the long-term plan is to work together in person regularly - hence it's important to note that we are based in Stockholm, Sweden. Relocation is something we would offer for an excellent match.

Feel free to reach out if you have any specific questions about the role, otherwise just apply directly at:

https://deds.ulb.ac.be/

Hi guys, a nice dual PhD opportunity in Barcelona and Greece :earth_africa:

I attach the details below, if you have any questions, send me a message

<https://deds.ulb.ac.be/>
ESR 2.1:
        Transparent in-situ data processing
*Objectives*: Bringing computation closer to data is a must when dealing with large datasets in highly distributed systems with very specialised hardware components. Some relevant examples are supporting in-situ data transformations (e.g., decrypt on read) and tier crossings (e.g., select the form of compression based on physical medium to be moved to). The goal of this project is to improve the performance of the data processing engine, such as Spark, by leveraging hardware specificities, without affecting the interface to applications. The approach consists in improving scalability by decoupling the engine primitives from the underlying data store platform, in such a way that tasks can be delegated to avoid data transfers through the different levels of the stack, and benefit from specific hardware.
*Expected Results*: (1) A framework to allow data operators to ship code to be executed in-place at the low-level store. (2) A method to communicate available in-place computation capabilities. (3) Connectors to the low-level store for a Big Data processing engine. (4) Evaluation of the connectors.
*Home Institute:* UPC
*Host Institute:* ARC
*Secondment:* BSC, Summer 2022, 3 months, within the project ELASTIC providing both hardware and a complex scenario in a distributed high performance computing system with real traffic data and data processing needs.
